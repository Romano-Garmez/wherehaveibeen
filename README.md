## Ever heard of a little game called Forza Horizon?

I've always found the idea of a map that shows the places you've discovered fascinating. Forza Horizon implemented a map that had every road greyed out until you drove over it once. It encouraged you to drive every road in the entire game, exploring the map.

I've been looking for more excuses to get out and see things I haven't seen before, so I built WhereHaveIBeen to mark which areas of the "map" have already been discovered by me.

WhereHaveIBeen is a web app to display your OwnTracks location history while doing some extra processing to snap the routes between each location update to roads. This allows you to see the exact route you've taken, without wasting your phone battery by uploading location every second.

## What's on the way?

Next up will be a better user settings system. Currently, settings are wiped on page refresh! It's important to fix this as I intend to add advanced settings to use your own OSRM router to draw the route on the map. 

Currently I host an OSRM server with the data from Washington, Oregon, and California, but if you live elsewhere that won't be helpful.
