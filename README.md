## Ever heard of a little game called Forza Horizon?

I've always found the idea of a map that shows the places you've discovered fascinating. Forza Horizon implemented a map that had every road greyed out until you drove over it once. It encouraged you to drive every road in the entire game, exploring the map.

I've been looking for more excuses to get out and see things I haven't seen before, so I built WhereHaveIBeen to mark which areas of the "map" have already been discovered by me.

WhereHaveIBeen is a web app to display your OwnTracks location history while doing some extra processing to snap the routes between each location update to roads. This allows you to see the exact route you've taken, without wasting your phone battery by uploading location every second.

## What's on the way?
More settings! 

Hopefully a Google Maps Timeline import feature, as Timeline is changing to be local device only and will no longer be accessible online.

---
## Recently added!
A better user settings system. Settings are no longer wiped on page refresh! You can change map buffer settings and the OSRM routing URL and WhereHaveIBeen will remmeber.

Currently I host an OSRM server with the data from Washington, Oregon, and California, but if you live elsewhere you can use your own. If you are unable to/unwilling to host your own, you can use the url for the public OSRM demo server.
